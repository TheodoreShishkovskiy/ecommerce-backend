### Description
The goal here was to build the back-end coding for an e-commerce website. With a working Express.js API, we needed to configure it in a way it would use Sequelize and interect with the information we have stored in the MySQL database.

## Installation
To get this ball rolling you will need to clone or fork this repository to your local machine. Step one would be to go into the terminal and 'npm i' to install the needed dependencies. In order to initiate the database you must go to Mysql with 'mysql -u root -p' then enter 'source/schema.sql' to create the necessary tables. Exit the MySQL terminal and into your terminal enter 'npm run seed' and then enter 'npm start'. Your server should start!
